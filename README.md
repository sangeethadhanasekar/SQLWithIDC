# 🔥 My 21-Days SQL Challenge Journey (Indian Data Club)

This is my space - my 21-day SQL journey.  
I’m taking part in the **Indian Data Club’s 21-Days SQL Challenge**, and this repo is like my personal logbook.  

I’ll be using it as a kind of **self-note** - to track how my streak keeps burning each day.  
And to keep that fire alive, I’ll create my **own SQL logical WH' questions** every day and try to answer them myself.  

If you (yes, you reading this 👀) have a better answer or a new idea -- feel free to share it!  
I’m always open to learning and improving.  

Each day’s folder/file will include:
- challenge solution
- My question and solution (or attempt 😅)  
- A short note or takeaway  

And yep, I’ll also list all my questions here in the README so my whole 21-day streak lives in one place.

Let’s keep the streak burning 🔥
